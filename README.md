# **Java Sorting and Searching**

## **IFS L3T03 - Sorting and Searching**

## **Description**
This is a Java program that demonstrates different sorting and searching methods.

1. The [ArrayLists.java](src/ArrayLists.java) file contains: 
* An Album class with a constructor method, getter and setter methods,  and a 'toString()' method to create 
two ArrayLists of Album objects (named 'albums1' and 'albums2').
* A Selection Sort method that sorts the 'albums1' ArrayList by number of songs, in ascending order.
* A Quick Sort method that sorts the 'albums2' ArrayList's objects into alphabetical order based on album names.
* A Binary Search method to find a given album's index in 'albums2''s sorted ArrayList.

2. The [BubbleSort.java](src/BubbleSort.java) file contains:
* A BubbleSort class that implements the Bubble Sort algorithm on the given ArrayList and prints out the sorted list.

3. The [SortAndSearch.java](src/SortAndSearch.java) file contains:
* A SortAndSearch class that implements the Linear and Binary Search algorithms on the given ArrayList to 
find a given element's index and implements the Insertion Sort method on the given ArrayList to print out the 
sorted list.
